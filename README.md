# FT_CONTAINERS

> 42 project, the implementation of templated classes that behave exactly like the C++ 98 STL containers.

## What to implement :

- Iterators :
> Iterators are used to point at the memory addresses of STL containers. They are primarily used in sequence of numbers, characters etc. They reduce the complexity and execution time of program.
- Vector:
> - Vectors are same as dynamic arrays with the ability to resize itself automatically when an element is inserted or deleted, 
- Stack :
> - A stack is a standard C++ container adapter, designed to be used in a LIFO context, and is implemented with an interface/wrapper to the type passed to it as a template argument, which defaults to a deque.  
- Map :
> - Map is dictionary like data structure. It is a sequence of (key, value) pair, where only single value is associated with each unique key.


## The Data structure used for imlementing Map:
> the Data structure used for implementing those containers is AVL TREE, and this latter is a self-balancing binary search tree where each node has an extra bit, and that bit is often interpreted as Balance factor.
